# UCX-Py Hello World

This example will demonstrate how to use UCX Python bindings. For more information please see the [UCX-Py ReadTheDocs site](https://ucx-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [related repos](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucx-py). 

Note that we didn't cover this example in the tutorial, so this is currently a future topic to be added!
