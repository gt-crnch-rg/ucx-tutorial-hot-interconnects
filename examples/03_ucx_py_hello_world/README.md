# UCX-Py Hello World

This example demonstrates how to use UCX Python bindings. For more information please see the [UCX-Py ReadTheDocs site](https://ucx-py.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [related repos](https://github.com/rapidsai/ucx-py). 

As a first step make sure you have installed any dependencies and also that you have built and installed UCX. See [this page](https://github.com/gt-crnch-rg/ucx-tutorial-hoti-21/blob/main/examples/Installing_UCX_README.md) for more details on installation. 


## Compile this example
```
#Edit setenv.sh to point to your UCX installation: `export UCX_ROOT=<path_to_UCX_INSTALL>`
source setenv.sh
make
```
